      "text": "Training large-scale reinforcement learning agents requires significant computational resources. Distributed training can accelerate this process, but introduces challenges in communication overhead, synchronization, and sample efficiency. This project develops a scalable framework that addresses these issues."

    {
      "title": "Method",
      "text": "We design an asynchronous distributed RL framework with hierarchical communication. Agents operate in parallel, collecting experiences independently, while a central coordinator aggregates gradients and updates policy parameters. The system uses prioritized experience replay and gradient compression to minimize communication costs."
    },
    {
      "title": "Results",
      "text": "Our framework achieves near-linear scaling up to 64 workers, with minimal performance degradation. Training time for complex tasks is reduced by 8x compared to single-worker training. The system maintains sample efficiency while significantly improving wall-clock time."
